 <h2> Welcome to Cripple Cruise Lines </h2>
 <h3> Your Accessible Journey Awaits! </h3>
 <p> At Cripple Cruise Lines, we believe that the joy of travel belongs to everyone. Our mission is to provide a fully accessible, inclusive, and stress-free cruise experience designed specifically for people with disabilities and mobility considerations. Here, accessibility isn't an afterthought - it's the foundation of everything we do.</p>
 <h3> A Cruise Experience Without Compromise </h3>
 <p>Planning a vacation shouldn’t feel like a battle. With us, it doesn’t.</p>
 <p>Our ships are built to eliminate the typical barriers travelers with disabilities often face. From fully ADA-compliant design to staff trained in disability-inclusive hospitality, we ensure that every guest can explore, relax, and enjoy themselves with complete confidence.</p>
 <h3> More Than a Cruise - A Community </h3>
 <p>We know the challenges many travelers face: limited access, confusing policies, inadequate accommodations, or feeling like an afterthought.
 <p>At Cripple Cruise Lines, you’re not “working around” your needs—you’re celebrated for who you are.</p>
 <p>We are proud to create a space where travelers with disabilities, their families, and their caregivers can enjoy a true, carefree vacation with dignity, comfort, and joy.</p>
